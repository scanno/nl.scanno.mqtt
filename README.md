# MQTT Client for Homey

This app was initially based on the MQTT Client for Homey developed by Johan Kuster.

With this app you will be able to send messages to a topic and receive messages from a topic.

The app contains two cards;<br>
One for subscribing to a topic and receiving messages from that topic.<br>
With the other card you will be able to send a message to a topic.

Wildcards in a topic are supported.

The settings page contains:
- The option to use the HiveMQ public broker
- IP address or DNS name of the broker to connect
- Port number to connect
- The option to use a secure session (TLS). No support for self-signed certificates
- Possibility to bypass certificate check in case of self-signed certificates
- Userid for the broker connection
- Password for the broker connection

# You need access to a MQTT broker to be able to use this app.
